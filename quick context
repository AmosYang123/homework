1. This project is being deployed on a Vercel app called homeworkcheeter.vercel.app
2. This is for my school computer and my school computer may block some things but I'm sure it doesn't block all things
3. This is being deployed on GitHub but never, never push out anything to GitHub without me asking you to
4. Always tell me when I need to update something in my SupaBase, and how do you set this up? Easiest for me you add another set of database filesThat's for example v3 is the next one so I can quickly copy the whole thing and then paste it in without any overlapping problems.
