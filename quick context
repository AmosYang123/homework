1. This project is being deployed on a Vercel app called homeworkcheater.vercel.app
2. This is for my school computer and my school computer may block some things but I'm sure it doesn't block all things
3. This is being deployed on GitHub but never, never push out anything to GitHub without me asking you to
4. Always tell me when I need to update something in my SupaBase, and how do you set this up? Easiest for me you add another set of database filesThat's for example v3 is the next one so I can quickly copy the whole thing and then paste it in without any overlapping problems. 
5.Never leave me with problems in the terminal. What I'm talking about is after you finish this response, you should check the problem section in the terminal to see if there's any problems detected in the workspace. If there are any problems, you should fix them right away.
